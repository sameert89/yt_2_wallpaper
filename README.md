# YT2Wallpaper User Documentation
Welcome to YT2Wallpaper! This application allows you to set YouTube or YouTube Music videos as live wallpapers on your Windows desktop.

## Getting Started
Before diving into the world of dynamic wallpapers, make sure you have your desired YouTube or YouTube Music video open in a separate browser window. This can be any browser of your choice, as YT2Wallpaper is compatible with all major browsers.

## Setting Up Your Wallpaper
- *Launch YT2Wallpaper:* Open the YT2Wallpaper application on your Windows system.

- *Select Target Application:* From the menu, choose whether you want to set a YouTube video or a YouTube Music video as your wallpaper, then click search.

- *Choose Video Window:* If you have multiple browser windows open, select the appropriate one from the dropdown menu within the YT2Wallpaper application.

- *Set as Wallpaper:* Once you've selected the target application and the desired video window, simply press the "Set" button to make it your wallpaper.

## Removing the Wallpaper
If you wish to revert to your regular desktop background or switch to a different video, follow these steps:

- *Open YT2Wallpaper:* Launch the YT2Wallpaper application again.

- *Press "Unset":* Click the "Unset" button to unlock the window and return your desktop background to its previous state.

## Consider Supporting Development
YT2Wallpaper is a hobby project. If you find this application useful and would like to see further improvements and features, consider giving this repo a star!

## Known Issues
1. Program crashes when no youtube/youtube music windows is open.
2. Cannot see desktop icons/taskbar: For the taskbar just make sure auto hide is not enabled, press the windows key once and click out and you should see the taskbar. As for desktop icons, windows currently does not allow active windows to go under icon layer, I am working on a plausible fix.
